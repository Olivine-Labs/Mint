      <h2>Unmatched Speed.</h2>

      <p>Speed, flexibility, simplicity. Pick three.</p>

      <p>
        Mint uses the Lua language, a language whose speed blows away all other
        scripting languages, and even many compiled languages - including Ruby,
        Python, and Node.js. It has immeasurable flexibility, and can be used
        with functional, object-oriented, or procedural styles. <strong>It's
        pretty awesome.</strong>

      <h2>Development done right.</h2>

      <p>
        Mint's built for modern web applications. Built by leading front-end
        and server-side engineers, it offers <em>just the right</em> amount of
        help; you won't get bogged down in configuration changes or be forced
        to learn any esoteric templating languages. By default, it ships using
        <strong>MongoDB</strong> and <strong>Mustache templating</strong>.

      <h2>Scalable architecture.</h2>

      <p>
        As you build your web application, you're building a RESTful API.
        Design and expose your models by creating database models, and expose
        those collections as a JSON API. You consume your own API as you build
        your pages, and can trivially use <strong>Backbone.js</strong> or any
        client-side framework to build a javascript-driven application. It's
        your choice; Mint makes it easy.
      </p>

      <h2>Getting started is easy.</h2>

      <p>
        Even if you don't know Lua, it's very easy to pick up, especially if
        coming from a background in Javascript, Ruby, or any functional
        language. Drop Mint in your application as a Git subtree, or download
        the repository and plop the folder in your application's root. (We'll
        be releasing it as a Luarocks module in the future.)
