I wanted to make a quick plug for <a class="zem_slink" title="Zemanta" rel="homepage" href="http://www.zemanta.com">Zemanta</a>; a utility that- I think, anyway- has helped me rapidly improve the quality of my blog posts. Yeah, the awful writing style's still the same, but it allows me to throw in pictures, and pictures make everything better! It also has tools that link up key words to <a class="zem_slink" title="Wikipedia" rel="homepage" href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> articles and other websites (all I did was select which words I wanted linked; I didn't actually make the links on this post links manually), help you tag your posts, and give you a list of other blog posts that are related to the one you're currently writing. It integrates perfectly seamlessly into <a class="zem_slink" title="WordPress" rel="homepage" href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, and gives you "reblog" links on other people's <a class="zem_slink" title="Blog" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blogs</a> to quickly jump in and respond. I love the program; I highly suggest it to anyone.

A shameless plug, yes; but a worthy one.
