It's recently occurred to me that it may be a good idea to go ahead and
accumulate both of my blogs, my websites, and those of my colleagues. I
purchased a domain name off of a whim (I found some humor in the domain
name, http://internetvir.us, but not everybody shares my humor, I
guess) and started mocking up a design. And, while I was at it, figured
what the heck, and made it XHTML-strict compliant.

So, sooner or
later, InternetVirus will be running on my Ubuntu box mentioned
earlier. Just gotta figure out the whole nameserver thing, and I should
be good to go.

On the recommendation of a coworker, I'm looking at installing <a href="http://movabletype.org/">MovableType</a>
for his blogging engine. I might switch as well, haven't decided yet; I
like the idea of hosting my own engine, though. Blogger's been good to
me, but it just may be time to switch over. I just need to weigh out
the options and really decide what I want.
