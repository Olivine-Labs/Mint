  Thanks! I'll be moving into some of the JSON stuff soon, to implement in the next version of my online game (Neflaria; it's had the same code since 2001 so it's in desperate need of an upgrade). We're rearchitecting the PHP to use OO patterns, and I haven't worked with JSON much before, so I may take you up on that.

You do make good points as well but I think the main thing to keep in mind is not to tag CSS vs Tables but rather what are the appropriate times to use each.

  Doing CSS layout should be as simple that a 12 year old could do it.
  
  CSS for layout is trash because I have three children, mortgage, responsibilities, chores, friends and still more. 
  
  CSS for layout is trash because it cots too much to get it done as opposed to what it could've been. 
  
  CSS for layout should be followed buy a universal revolt. You think I'm such a fool as to waste my precious time in this short life to fix some hacks that a committee spewed out? Indeed, CSS for layout is the result of collective ignorance of what people's lives is worth. Yes, when you steal my time, I take it personal.
  
  Yes, I do have to display stuff in the browser. Thank you very much, I enjoy my job.
  
  Go hack away at your leisure. You must be an adolescent who gets obsessed over some shadows on your page design.

  Indeed it appears to have become a personal issue. I'll reiterate the point that if you know how to use CSS, it's not hard. It doesn't take up time. It doesn't cost too much if you know how to utilize the tools you're given. To somebody who doesn't understand how to use the technology, tables make sense.
  
  However, I believe that just because something's hard, you shouldn't give up on it. An accessible, liquid design, to me, is more important than churning out a design using tables. I learned this lesson the hard way recently; I decided to take a shortcut on a design I had been working on. Then, after it was all done, the designer made several changes to how the content boxes fit into each page. And, now I was back at square one. However, had I used CSS and done it the right way, it may have taken 50% longer, but that means I would have also saved time, not having to do it twice; it's much easier to change CSS, once it's finished.
  
  If you never have to maintain the design.. sure, use tables. But that's hardly the case, and it's a slippery slope.
  
  And I am obsessed about "the shadows on my page design", because what I deliver to my client should be the best I can possibly do, and nothing less. I refuse to offer anything other than my best.

  CSS is not hard. Believe me. Just read few old articles from A List Apart and everything comes clear. I love separating the content and design. It is simple. Certainly there are things I'd like to have (like :odd selector), but usually Javascript comes quite handy.
  
  Don't get me wrong - I came through the table design (I started in '96) I still use it for HTML emails. The moment you realise the power of CSS is when you start to use a changeable content. There are things which are simply impossible without using 3 or more nested tables - that looks horrible. In CSS it is just another logical DOM Element (like ul or div). 
  
  Try to read your table designed page in Fangs - you may feel like a blind person - table information is an important part content, div is layout.
  
  Give it a try - build something simple, avoid hacks, test in Firefox with Firebug, check in IE/Safari evry half an hour. If it is something new it'll not be simple from the beginning.
  
  Shouw some courage people

Using it just because it is the *right* thing to do makes about as much sense as using a razor to trim eye lashes - that is, it is possible, but why try it when there are far easier ways of getting stuff done.

  CSS is good for certain types of layout (eg. web pages, like duh) but is terrible for traditional types of layout (eg. dynamic application type interfaces). That is why web applications (even the most sophisticated Google ones) still fall so far short of any complex application out there. 
  
  After wrestling with CSS to try and get my moderately complex GWT working right (the Java is easy, the CSS is horrid) I abandoned it and went to a WebStart application where I could use all the power of Swing's layout managers (once you spend the hour required to master GridBagLayout you realise how poor CSS is in comparison). Sure I could get the CSS to work correctly and possibly layout correctly but the tool/debugging support (Firebug) is second rate compared to rich-client equivalents. IMHO CSS is ok if all you're doing is simple stuff (which is why it's defenders see no problems) but it (and it's tool environment) just isn't good enough to push webapps to the next level.

  Jack,
  Flash is not only still needed, but in many ways better than jquery.  Flash gets rendered as vector graphics, so the image quality is the same at any scale and resolution.  If I have a demo looping on a monitor at a trade show, for example, it sure as hell won't be in JQuery.  Most ActionScript will be less lines of code than JQuery also.
  
  Jquery is convenient and nice for most usages, but doesn't replace flash.
  
  PS this is Jason, of TimeManager fame.

  Jason-
  
  jQuery can handle SVG in modern browsers (of course, that's me assuming you're using a modern browser); and I agree - for looping demos and movies, that's where Flash reigns. Perhaps "Flash is Dead" was a bad title; maybe it should be "Flash is being reduced to what it was designed for". And I've done absolutely amazing things in one or two lines of jQuery - and that compiled flash file is most likely going to be a much larger filesize than jQuery (which may already be cached if we're pulling from Google's servers) plus whatever code I wrote.
  
  And awesome... how's it going? I owe pretty much everything I have today to TimeManager's code and working (the tiny bit I did) with .NET, so thanks (bit understated though a "thanks" may be).

  Just FYI: You do realize the reason Chrome is faster is precisely because it doesn't have extensions right? Compare an extensionless Firefox to Chrome. Same speed.
  
  If you want the speed you can't also have the extensions. Pick and choose. Just thought you might like to know.
  
  Also, 8 seconds? Jesus what do you have installed. Mine loads in about 4, with a dozen extensions.

  Jack I completely agree with you.  I was having this conversation with someone a few weeks ago.  
  
  My big problem with ASP.Net is that it abstracts the idea that ultimately you are just sending html to the browser.  I've had so many developers tell me that they can't do something because they don't know how to do it in a gridview.  
  
  I use ASP.Net all the time.  I love the idea of data binding.  I love using C#-- it feels natural.
  
  But I hate the Page_Load event.  I hate post-backs.  I hate controls that render html I have no control over.  Most of the controls hardly seem necessary.  You could easily use basic HTML (although controls like the calendar control and wizard control are very cool).
  
  PHP is closer to the HTML (like classic ASP was).  You know what's going to the browser.  But PHP is an ugly language.  It doesn't compile.  The object-orientation feels like it was cobbled together at the last minute ($variable=&gt;"foo").  
  
  I really like the way they move away from all this with the MVC framework.  No code behind pages and few controls.

  @Eric Wroolie:
  
  Thanks, Eric- we're definitely in agreement. Page_Load, postbacks, no control over html... but the temptation for easy controls exists (though they come back to bite you later.) And that's my predicament: PHP is definitely a very ugly language. So my choice is between bloated complexity vs. ease of use... have to lesser of two evils based on the project.
  
  I'm working on a few MVC projects to get more familiar with the framework; it looks like it's the magic solvent. I hope it is, anyway.

content: Couldn't agree more... finally had to learn .Net for a specific project and not liking it at all. I love C# but the asp.net glue is terrible. I can't stand how it makes javascript more difficult with unpredictable control output and ID issues. Also I hate when it comes time to use css and I need to view my rendered source and reverse engineer the markup to style it. And evvverything is outputted in tables... even when you make a datalist and set templates, each item is still wrapped in a table row so if you wanted to template a datalist as a simple ordered list (OL) then by itself it cant be done without more work. Also the learning process seems more involved and also useless... I'm memorizing random property names for marking up control displays which is knowledge useless to me in any other areas of development. Why do I need to remember a control has a Direction property with accepted values of lefttoright or righttoleft which ultimately just adds a style="text-align:center" to the control.... a complete waste of memory. Also I do see the advantages of changing style properties programatically but it just feels wrong since the whole point of css was to separate presentation from structure and now we're tying it together with the application layer. Hopefully my last .net website project.

content: Ohh yeah one last thing I forgot... tutorials and support. It is IMPOSSIBLE to find any good tutorials on asp.net. First off the results are always diluted because of vb.net vs c# etc and then the multiple ways of doing the same things (objectdatasource, sqldatasources, databinding etc). And there is almost no community support for it at all. Searching for help with simple controls results in pages of mostly garage that doesnt apply or a bunch of tutorials that look like they used to be hosted on geocities. Finding good help is nearly impossible.

  Thanks for this it's exactly what I was looking for.
  
  I've found that in order to get page hierarchy to work in the editing screen (e.g. /about/history/ to actually cause History to appear indented beneath About) I've had to add "/index.php" to the end of the page name.
  
  i.e.
  <code>
  PerchSystem::set_page($route.'/index.php');
  </code>
  
  Not totally sure why, but it seems to be something to do with the way it determines what "level" each page is at. I guess it's because it was made to work with a directory structure where those index.php files would have to exist in each dir.
