I read something interesting today at <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/">Gizmodo</a>, a gadget news site I frequent. It was <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5024692/ktla-reporter-makes-fun-of-iphone-line+sitters-gets-called-a-jackass-on-live-tv">an article about a news reporter</a> who said some pretty rude things to the people standing in line for an iPhone. Someone left a comment about the video:

"Really, what is the difference between this and waiting in line to buy concert tickets or sports team season passes?<div class="content">
p. That's one thing that bothers me, you're a geek if you dress up as a
Star Trek character, but there's nothing wrong if you go to a sporting
even with no shirt on with one half of your body painted blue and the
other half orange and watch a bunch of grown men make millions of
dollars playing a game.


p. Different strokes for different folks.  But why is it socially acceptable to make fun of one but not the other?"

p. It's an interesting thought to chew on.
