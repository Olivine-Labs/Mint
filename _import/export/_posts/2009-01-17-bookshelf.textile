I've got a lot of books; just recently I ran to Ikea to pick up a huge shelf to manage the overflow. But, there's a group of books that I keep by my bookshelf, just in case I need a quick reference, or just feel like reading. Here's a breakdown, from right to left:

-Manual for an <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130136">MSI K9A2 Platinum motherboard</a> (honestly, not quite sure how that snuck in there)

-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/0465067107/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232213595&sr=8-1">The Design of Everyday Things</a>, an absolutely fantastic book; I'm only about 1/4 of the way through it, and already I love it. It's about the tiny little nuances about designing user-friendly things; it's not explicitly technical (more about physical objects than virtual ones), but it's definitely easy to cross it over into the web development / designing realm. I picked it up on reccomendation of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000020.html">Jeff Atwood</a>.

-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dreaming-Code-Programmers-Transcendent-Software/dp/1400082471/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232213621&sr=1-1">Dreaming In Code</a>, another really good book; I saw it in the library one day and decided to flip through it. It's a fantastic rendition of the exploits of the developers of Chandler, a personal information manager, and explains in detail how many things can go wrong with a software project; software is never on time, and the author (a reporter) does a great job in explaining how this phenomenon occurs.

-The Art of War, by Sun Tzu; it's hard to find a copy that's just the Art of War, and not 'the art of war in relation to business' or some such. It's pretty fascinating; it's about military strategy. I couldn't find this specific copy on Amazon; I think I got it from Barnes and Noble about two years back.

-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/jQuery-Action-Bear-Bibeault/dp/1933988355/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232213742&sr=1-1">jQuery in Action</a>; I love jQuery, more and more as each day passes, and I figured it was about time I picked up the book. The online documentation will always be more up-to-date, but I can't bring that in the car with me (without a 3G netbook, anyway), and the book is written so that I can read it from cover to cover. It has several interesting insights into the technical reasons of jQuery's architecture.

-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Comet-Reverse-Ajax-Next-Generation-Firstpress/dp/1590599985/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232213806&sr=1-1">Comet and Reverse Ajax</a>; one of the 'reccomended books' Amazon advertised to me while I was ordering jQuery in Action. It's really, really short, but it explains how to do something I never really thought possible with HTTP protocol: use a server push, instead of a client pull. This may mean Neflaria gets a real-time chat.

-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Red-Hat-Linux-8-Dummies/dp/0764516817/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232213835&sr=1-1">Red Hat Linux 8 for Dummies</a>; picked it up a long time ago when I was first experimenting with Linux. It does a really good job at getting a Linux dummy up to speed.

-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Self-Paced-Training-70-536-70-528-70-547/dp/0735623767/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232213880&sr=1-1">MCTS and MCPD books for .Net Framework 2.0 web development</a>; a set of 3 books written to get my MCPD. I hate the whole idea of certifications (I'm a firm believer that skill > credentials), but I figure I should get them eventually (because very few other people believe that).

-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/MCTS-Self-Paced-Training-70-431-Pro-Certification/dp/073562271X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232213913&sr=1-2">MCTS for SQL Server 2005</a>; see above. Although, has actually useful information, not garbage to memorize in the rare event that Visual Studio's intellisense and Google collectively collapse.

Top to bottom on left stack:

-<a href="http://www.wired.com/">Wired</a> magazines; Wired's awesome. It's like <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com">Gizmodo</a>, only in more detail.

-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Swing-Hacks-Tips-Tools-Killer/dp/0596009070/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232214019&sr=1-1">Swing Hacks</a>; when we (Don and I) were first looking at developing an MMORPG, we were trying to decide what language to use; consequently, I picked up a few Java books, this and the next two. I knew very little about Java at the time; it was the cross-platform compatibility that attracted me. It was the entire language that turned me off.

-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wicked-Cool-Java-Open-Source-Libraries/dp/1593270615/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232214038&sr=1-1">Wicked Cool Java</a>; has a lot of cool project ideas for developers at any stage. If you want to mess around with Java a bit, this is the book to get.

-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Killer-Game-Programming-Andrew-Davison/dp/0596007302/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232214063&sr=1-1">Killer Game Programming in Java</a>; what I expected, and yet somehow not. It takes you from developing your own graphical engine all the way through game mechanics, which is awesome; but, with the abundance of pre-made 3d/physics engines out there, it's more than I needed, so I never got more than halfway.

-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Out-Java-Control-Structures/dp/1576761711/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232214083&sr=1-3">Starting out with Java 5</a>; my CS classes were in Java, and this was the book I used. Highly reccomended for beginners.

The next book to go up there will be Digital Security, which is another amazing book; it totally opened my eyes, and changed the way I thought about security.Â  I'm only halfway through it now, so it's by my bed instead of on my bookshelf.
