So, I've recently had a pretty cool idea. I'm sure it's something
that's been done before by somebody, but it's a first for me, and after
a few weeks I'm still the only one in the office to have done this: I
took my two LCD monitors, and turned them sideways.

At first,
I'll admit, it was a bit of a joke. I didn't think I'd actually leave
it that way, but I wanted to see how it would work out. So, I've now
got two 19" widescreen monitors combined into one, slightly angled
large one. I'm actually really happy with the concept, too. It allows
me to see twice as much code, and most websites and applications are
designed for a 1024x768 screen resolution anyway; I've got a resolution
of 1024x1280 on each (2048x1040, technically), so I get the width while
having a nice newspaper-style height.

It also rocks using the
program UltraMon, which gives you a few easy little bits of
functionality like a button to switch from one monitor to the other, or
to stretch your taskbar across both screens, or even stretch a window
across both screens. It works out suprisingly well on Visual Studio to
stretch the window across for long lines, but be able to see a ton
vertically.
