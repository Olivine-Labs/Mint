I've finally gone to the dark side, and I'm trying out a dark theme for visual studio. I've used dark themes before, but they never really stuck too long; this time, however, I think I've finally come up with something I like.

Here's a few screenshots, and you can decide for yourself; I've included a zip file with the theme and font I used.
