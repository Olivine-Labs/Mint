Today was my last day at <a href="http://www.pillartechnology.com/">Pillar Technology</a>. I had an awesome time learning from the great people I worked with:
<ul>
	<li>Tim Wingfield (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/timwingfield">@timwingfield</a>)</li>
	<li>Michael Kramer (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/michaelkramer">@michaelkramer</a>)</li>
	<li>Rebecca Denning (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/RebeccaDenning">@rebeccadenning</a>)</li>
	<li>Todd Kauffman (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/toddkauffman">@toddkauffman</a>)</li>
	<li>Phil Jordan (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/philipjordan">@philipjordan</a>)</li>
	<li>Tyler Wymer (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/twymer">@twymer</a>)</li>
</ul>
I learned an incredible amount of time in the short time I was there, especially about Agile practices, TDD, proper spiraling of footballs, to blame Phil for everything, to embrace new technologies- even Apple, and how to pronounce "facade". That's "fuh-cade" with a long "a" and a hard "c"*. I've begun using vim for everything, I learned how to use Git, and I've picked up ReSharper and a finer understanding of development productivity.

I also, in turn, hope that I leave the team with a finer method of brewing coffee (fill the filter to the top, use fresh water, wash out the pot every time.) The proper times to do this are 9:15, 10:45, and 2:30.

As I move forward in my career to San Francisco, I'll look back upon this time and the knowledge and experienceI've gained, and I hope to retain these relationships.

And I'll continue to blame Phil.

_* I pronounced facade in this method (yes, incorrect), during my interview due to a prolongedÂ mispronunciation._
