I’ve recently joined a community for browser-based games developers.
I’ve had to fire up IRC for the first time in a while, but IRC has that
kind of nostalgic hot-chocolate-by-a-snowy-window comfortable feel to
it, doesn’t it? Well, that might just be me, I don’t know. But, at any
rate, there’s always a good conversation going on in the IRC channel or
in the forums, so if you’re interested in browser-based-games
development, it’s definitely worth checking out.

The IRC channel is \#bbg at irc.freenode.net
(<a title="Freenode Web IRC Client" href="http://webchat.freenode.net/" target="_blank">web
client here</a>) and the forums are at
<a title="BBGameZone" href="http://community.bbgamezone.net/" target="_blank">community.bbgamezone.net</a>.
One of the members also maintains a list of games that some of the
members have / are developing at
<a title="Fleeting Fantasy Game List" href="http://fleetingfantasy.com/game-list" target="_blank">fleetingfantasy.com/game-list</a>.
