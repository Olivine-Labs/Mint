    <h1>Getting Started</h1>

    <p>
      We're going to go through the following steps. Step 1 is based on our own
      hosting scheme, but you're welcome to use anything you're comfortable
      with. This assumes some basic knowledge of bash, Linux, and Git, although
      we'll keep it simple and detailed.

      <p>
        We use EC2 for everything, because it's easy and cheap, and it gives
        you the ability to make systems configurations changes really easily-
        it's a dedicated server on a budget.

      <p>
        You can do this one of two ways: simply download the code and put it,
        in your project, or if you're using Git, you can include it as a
        submodule and be able to fetch updates as we update the Mint
        repository.

          These instructions are based on what we found to be easeiest to work
          with. You may very well find it better to use a different hosting
          provider, or nginx instead of apache, or a different database
          solution; Mint doesn't have any restrictions, that's up to you. We
          set up defaults that accomodate rapid, modern development and allow
          you to change out modules externally to the Mint core systems.
