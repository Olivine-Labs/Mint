      We're going to go through the following steps. Step 1 is based on our own
      hosting scheme, but you're welcome to use anything you're comfortable
      with. This assumes some basic knowledge of bash, Linux, and Git, although
      we'll keep it simple and detailed.

          These instructions are based on what we found to be easeiest to work
          with. You may very well find it better to use a different hosting
          provider, or nginx instead of apache, or a different database
          solution; Mint doesn't have any restrictions, that's up to you. We
          set up defaults that accomodate rapid, modern development and allow
          you to change out modules externally to the Mint core systems.
